## Gameplay Mechanics
The core of *Ball Battle* revolves around a simple yet deep set of mechanics that drive its fast-paced, competitive nature. Below is a detailed breakdown of how the game operates:

- **Ball Movement:**
 - The ball bounces off all boundaries of the screen—left, right, top, and bottom walls—following realistic physics where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
 -When a player swings and hits the ball, its trajectory adjusts based on the point of contact and the swing’s force, sending it toward the opponent’s side or elsewhere in the play area. Each successful hit increases the ball’s speed, amplifying the challenge as the match progresses.
 -A player loses a life if the ball strikes them directly (e.g., they fail to hit it back) or if it escapes their designated "danger zone" (e.g., a boundary behind them), depending on the final design choice for lose conditions.
 - Hit Immunity Rule: The player who last struck the ball—referred to as the "owner of the ball"—is immune to its effects. The ball cannot harm them (e.g., deduct a life) until the opposing player successfully strikes it back, at which point ownership transfers and the ball becomes a threat to the original striker.
 - Pass-Through Mechanic: If the ball moves toward or through the "owner of the ball" (the last player who hit it), it passes through them without any physical interaction—no collision, redirection, or speed change occurs. The ball behaves as if the owner is intangible to it until the opponent strikes it, reinforcing the immunity rule.
 -Hit Stop Effect: When the ball reaches a predefined speed threshold (e.g., after a set number of hits or a specific velocity), a "hit stop" effect triggers upon the next successful strike. This effect briefly pauses the game for a fraction of a second (e.g., 0.1–0.3 seconds), freezing the ball and players in place mid-action to emphasize the impact. As the ball’s speed continues to increase with subsequent hits, the hit stop duration grows slightly longer each time (e.g., scaling from 0.1 seconds to 0.5 seconds max), amplifying the tension and giving players a moment to anticipate the ball’s next, even faster movement.
  -Purpose: The hit stop effect serves as both a visual and gameplay cue, highlighting the ball’s escalating speed and adding a cinematic flair to intense moments. It gives players a split-second breather to prepare for the next exchange, enhancing the strategic feel of timing their swings.
  -Implementation: The effect could be accompanied by visual feedback (e.g., a screen shake, a flash, or a slow-motion zoom) and sound (e.g., a sharp impact noise) to make it more pronounced.
  -Progression: The intensity increase could be tied to a formula, such as hit_stop_duration = base_duration + (ball_speed_factor * scaling_constant), ensuring it scales naturally with the game’s pace.
  

- **Player Actions:**
  - Players can move left and right along a horizontal plane, positioning themselves to intercept the ball.
  - A swing action allows players to hit the ball back toward their opponent. Timing is critical—swinging too early or too late can result in a miss.
  - Movement and swinging are the primary controls, requiring a balance of spatial awareness and quick reflexes.
  - Players can also jump, to try to dodge the ball or also to hit the ball in the air


- **Lives System:**
  - Each player begins with three lives, represented visually in the game’s UI.
  - A life is lost when a player is struck by the ball.
  - When a player lose a life, the match restart. And the ball goes back to the default speed

- **Match Flow:**
  - Matches are quick and intense, with the ball’s increasing speed ensuring that rounds escalate in difficulty.
  - The game continues until a player is knocked out (loses all lives), at which point the match restarts for another round of play.

## Visuals and User Interface
*Ball Battle* emphasizes a polished and engaging presentation to enhance the gameplay experience:

- **Sprites and Animations:**
  - Characters and the ball are rendered using detailed sprite sheets, providing a clean and appealing aesthetic.
  - Animations include player movement (left/right/jump), swinging motions, and idle states, as well as ball-specific effects like speed trails or impact visuals.
  - Visual feedback is a priority—when the ball is hit, speeds up, or strikes a player, distinct animations or effects signal these events to the player.

- **User Interface (UI):**
  - **Lives Display:** Each player’s remaining lives (e.g., icons or a numeric counter) are prominently shown on-screen.
  - **Ball Speed Meter:** A visual indicator (e.g., a bar, gauge, or color shift) tracks the ball’s current speed, helping players anticipate its movement.
  - **Match Status:** Simple text or icons inform players of key events, such as "Match Start," "Life Lost," or "Game Over."
  - The UI is designed to be minimal yet informative, ensuring it doesn’t distract from the fast-paced action.

## Platform Adaptations
*Ball Battle* is built to perform seamlessly across its target platforms, with controls and layouts tailored to each:

- **Mobile:**
  - Played in landscape (horizontal) mode to maximize screen space and align with the game’s left-to-right gameplay.
  - Touch controls are implemented for movement (e.g., swipe or tap to move left/right) and swinging (e.g., tap or hold to swing).
  - The interface is optimized for smaller screens, with UI elements scaled and positioned for thumb-friendly access.

- **Web:**
  - Played in a browser window with keyboard and mouse controls (e.g., arrow keys or WASD for movement, spacebar or mouse click for swinging).
  - The game adapts to various screen resolutions, ensuring compatibility with desktops, laptops, and tablets running web browsers.
  - Performance is optimized to run smoothly across modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Inspiration
*Ball Battle* is heavily inspired by *Lethal League*, a cult-classic fighting game where players hit a ball back and forth, aiming to strike their opponent as the ball’s speed increases with each hit. The original game’s focus on reflexes, timing, and escalating tension forms the foundation of *Ball Battle*. However, this project adapts the formula for broader accessibility:
- Simplified controls cater to mobile touchscreens and web inputs, lowering the entry barrier for new players.
- Cross-platform support extends the game’s reach beyond traditional gaming setups.
- The horizontal mobile layout and life-based system add a unique twist while preserving the core thrill of *Lethal League*.

The goal is to retain the addictive, high-energy gameplay of its inspiration while making it portable and playable anywhere, anytime.

- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Move the player and swing. Confirm animations play correctly and ball effects appear during motion or hits."

---

### 4. User Interface
#### Task 4.1: Create Ball Speed Meter
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, add a UI element (e.g., bar or gauge) to show the ball’s speed. Update it in real-time as the ball’s speed changes."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Hit the ball multiple times and check if the speed meter updates accurately with the ball’s speed."

#### Task 4.2: Display Player Lives
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, add UI elements to show each player’s lives, starting at 3. Update the display when a life is lost."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Confirm both players’ lives display as 3. Simulate a life loss and verify the UI updates."

#### Task 4.3: Add Match Status UI
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, create UI text for match status (e.g., 'Match Start', 'Game Over'). Position it visibly on-screen."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Check that the match status displays and updates during gameplay."

---

### 5. Game Logic
#### Task 5.1: Implement Match Start and Restart
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, code logic to start a match and restart it when a player loses. Reset ball and player positions and set lives to 3."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Trigger a restart and confirm the ball, players, and lives reset correctly."

#### Task 5.2: Manage Player Lives
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, code life tracking. Reduce a player’s life when hit by the ball (only if the opponent last hit it) or if it enters their danger zone."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Simulate an opponent hitting the ball to harm a player. Check that their life decreases and UI updates."

#### Task 5.3: Define Win/Lose Conditions
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, code win/lose logic. When a player’s lives reach 0, show 'Game Over' and restart the match."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game. Reduce a player’s lives to 0. Verify 'Game Over' displays and the match restarts."

---

### 6. Platform-Specific Adjustments
#### Task 6.1: Optimize for Mobile
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, set the game to landscape mode for mobile. Add touch controls: swipe for movement, tap for swing."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game on a mobile emulator in landscape mode. Test touch controls for smooth movement and swinging."

#### Task 6.2: Optimize for Web
- **Prompt:** "In Trae, optimize assets and code for web performance. Ensure keyboard controls work (e.g., arrows for movement, space for swing)."
- **Test Prompt:** "Run the game in a browser. Test keyboard controls and check for smooth performance with no lag."

---

## Additional Notes
- **Prompt Design:** Each prompt is short and focused on one task to ensure clarity and reduce errors.
