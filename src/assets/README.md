# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files for the game:

1. `background.png` - The game's background image
2. `player.png` - The player character sprite

Please ensure the images are in PNG format and use appropriate dimensions:
- Background: Should match the game's dimensions (800x600)
- Player: Should be proportional to the player's size in game (30x120)

Note: The images should be optimized for web use to ensure good performance.
